PySimpleGUIPySimpleGUI# `Precise Astrometry` Use case

Client authors want to recognise all information in catalogues relevant to
precision astrometry (e.g., distances or radial velocities as necessary in foreshortening
calculations). This also involves the position of the observer, at
least for a few standard reference positions. Of course it would be beneficial
to be able to express actual observer positions, but in order to keep the
model manageable, we suggest deferring this to provenance. (SourceDM WD)
