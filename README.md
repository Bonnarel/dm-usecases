# dm-usecases

- During fall 2020 Interop we had a session that aimed at opening a wide discussion on both Measure and Coordinate models and possibly at refining their usages.

- This came after a long discussion on the mailing list, related to the necessity of keeping or not a tight dependancy between Measurements and Coordinates. 
- It has also been suggested that product models (e.g. CubeDM ) could be replaced with domain related components.
- Many people have participated to the discussion with many positive contributions and we can note a few points:
  - There is a clear demand for using models
  - There is a clear demand for the models to be simple and modular.
  - The distinction between what is modelling and what is serialisation is unclear.
  
- The need for a concrete solution for annotating catalog data has been tackled by the WG for a couple of years along with the development of Meas/Coordinates models.
  - 2018:Discussions have been engaged on this topic after a hands-on session in Victoria.

  - 2019: We asked data providers and client developers to present their needs in a dedicated session at Paris

- After these 2 surveys the scope of the model usage has been exposed in Virtual May and we have been working on MANGO (model for source data with some MC adaptations ) that has been sketched in Groningen and in virtual-May and then presented last week.

- To continue this action we propose to organise a virtual workshop (initially proposed by Tom to the TCG) with the hope of getting a widely accepted framework.
- The idea is not to start afresh but to give to the participants the opportunity of matching their needs with the current proposals.
- To get a clear picture of what has to be done, we propose to work with a variety concrete use cases and data samples provided by interested people.
